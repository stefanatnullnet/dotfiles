"dotfiles" and system configuration
===================================

A collection of my personal dotfiles
------------------------------------

Display the contents of the directory as [tree-like structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanatnullnet/dotfiles/main/tree) in plain text

Use Apprentice colors
-----------------
To get the most out of my dotfiles I recommend installing [Apprentice theme](https://romainl.github.io/Apprentice/)on your system. This will allow you to have unified colors in all your command line applications. If you see that some colors are off when using my setup, set your terminal emulator to use the Apprentice colorscheme instead of its default colors.

Additional configuration
------------------------
Some of the configurations need additional setup or configuration. If that's the case you can find a `README.md` file in the application's directory. Make sure to take a look at it to see what else there is to do to make the configuration work on your system.
